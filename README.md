#####[Try out the app here!](https://graphiteblogs.herokuapp.com/)


#### How it works

Graphite is a responsive digital blogging platform App. It allows a User to scroll through posts that have been uploaded by other Users. Favorite posts can be followed and then viewed in a separate tab. New posts can be created using a Wysiwyg text editor. THis means that the content can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when displayed as a finished product. The Wysiwyg text editor also allows you to add blogs, quotes, images, and videos.



#### The build

* This is a RESTful MEAN-stack app
* The app was built using the Express framework, MongoDB, AngularJS, and Node.js
* HTML 5, SCSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript were used to style the app
* User authentication is done using bcrypt
* Gulp was used as the task manager

#### How to run the application:

1. Gulp and Node must be installed
2. Populate the database by running the following command in the root directory of the application using the terminal: ```node db/seeds.js```
3. Install the relevant NPM and Bower packages by running the commands: ``` npm i && bower i ```
4. Launch mongod and gulp in two separate terminal windows
5. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the site

#### Highlights & Challenges
* Incorporating a Wysiwyg text editor in project
* Better understanding of how front- and back-end interact with one another
* Getting better at JavaScript and using AngularJS
* Using embedded databases still a bit of a challenge but getting thereâ€¦
* Front-end controllers 


#### Future Work
* Display blogs by categories
* Add search field to find specific topics
* Always display most up-to-date posts
* Add some CSS animation
* Add social networking links/functionality
(Possibly be able to add comments)





#### How to run locally
* go into project-4/wdi__project_4 directory
* launch mongod
* launch gulp
* open localhost:3000/ in browser window
